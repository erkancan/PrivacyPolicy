  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta muted">Last updated: January 3, 2026</p>

  <p><strong>We</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) are committed to protecting your privacy.
     This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect via our mobile applications, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>

  <h2>1) What this policy covers</h2>
  <p>This policy applies to the mobile applications developed by us (collectively, the "Services" or "App"), websites or pages that link to it, and customer support interactions.</p>

  <h2>2) Information we collect</h2>
  <h3>a) Information you add</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User Content & Logs:</strong> Data you explicitly enter into the App depending on its functionality (e.g., tasks, notes, health logs, preferences, timers, goals).</li>
    <li><strong>Profiles:</strong> Names, dates, or other profile information you create within the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Support messages:</strong> Content of emails you send to us for support or feedback.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>b) Information collected automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device data:</strong> Device model, OS version, app version, language, region, time zone.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage & diagnostics:</strong> Basic, de-identified analytics such as feature usage and crash logs to improve stability and UX.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Note on Sensitive Data:</strong> Some of our Apps may allow you to track health or biometric data. We only process this data to provide the App’s core features (tracking, insights, reminders) locally on your device or via secure cloud storage if enabled. We never sell your personal data.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>3) How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core features (logging, charts, insights, reminders, notifications).</li>
    <li>Personalize in-app suggestions based on your usage history.</li>
    <li>Maintain safety, debug issues, and prevent abuse.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about updates or support requests.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Legal bases (EEA/UK/CH)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract:</strong> To provide the App and features you request.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> To improve the App (e.g., aggregate, de-identified analytics) and ensure security.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For optional notifications, tracking, or where required by law. You can revoke consent in iOS Settings or in-app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Data sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited data with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers</strong> who process data on our behalf (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, cloud infrastructure) under confidentiality and data protection obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal or safety</strong> recipients if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, we will notify you and your rights will continue to be protected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User content and profiles are retained until you delete them in the App or request deletion.</li>
    <li>Diagnostics and crash logs are typically retained for up to 24 months, unless a longer period is required for security, compliance, or debugging.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Your choices & rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access, rectify, delete:</strong> You can edit or delete your data in the App. You can also request a copy or deletion by emailing <a href="mailto:erkancanmac@gmail.com">erkancanmac@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out of analytics/notifications:</strong> Control in the App and iOS Settings &gt; Notifications / Privacy.</li>
    <li><strong>EEA/UK/CH users:</strong> You may have rights to object or restrict processing, and to data portability. You can lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</li>
    <li><strong>California residents:</strong> You may have rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including access and deletion. We do not sell or “share” your data for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise in a specific App description, our Apps are designed for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal data directly from children under the age of 13 without parental consent. If you believe a child has provided personal data to us, contact us to delete it.</p>

  <h2>9) International transfers</h2>
  <p>We may process data on servers located outside your country. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) to protect your information.</p>

  <h2>10) Security</h2>
  <p>We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect your data (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; please use strong device passcodes and keep backups.</p>

  <h2>11) Third-party links</h2>
  <p>The App may link to third-party resources (e.g., help articles). Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.</p>

  <h2>12) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our Apps or laws. We will post the new effective date above.</p>

  <h2>13) Contact us</h2>
  <p>Email: <a href="mailto:erkancanmac@gmail.com">erkancanmac@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>14) Terms of Use</h2>
  <p>By using our Apps, you also agree to Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standard End User License Agreement (EULA)</a>.</p>
