  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta muted">Last updated: October 7, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Pumping Tracker</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy.
     This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>

  <h2>1) What this policy covers</h2>
  <p>This policy applies to the Pumping Tracker iOS app, websites or pages that link to it, and customer support interactions.</p>

  <h2>2) Information we collect</h2>
  <h3>a) Information you add</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Feeding &amp; pumping logs:</strong> times, duration, side (left/right/both), volumes, notes, bottle source (fresh/fridge/freezer), reminders, goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Profiles:</strong> baby name or nickname, birth date or due date (optional), and any labels you choose to add.</li>
    <li><strong>Support messages:</strong> content of emails you send to us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>b) Information collected automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device data:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, language, region, time zone.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage &amp; diagnostics:</strong> basic, de-identified analytics such as feature usage and crash logs to improve stability and UX.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>Sensitive data note:</strong> Feeding and pumping logs may be considered health-related information. We only process this data to provide the app’s core features (tracking, insights, reminders) and never sell it.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>3) How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide core features (logging, charts, insights, reminders, freezer expiry notifications).</li>
    <li>Personalize in-app suggestions (e.g., best time windows based on your history).</li>
    <li>Maintain safety, debug issues, and prevent abuse.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about updates or support requests.</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Legal bases (EEA/UK/CH)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contract:</strong> to provide the app and features you request.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to improve the app (e.g., aggregate, de-identified analytics) and ensure security.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> for optional notifications or where required by law. You can revoke consent in iOS Settings or in-app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Data sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share limited data with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers</strong> who process data on our behalf (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, cloud infrastructure) under confidentiality and data protection obligations.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal or safety</strong> recipients if required by law or to protect rights, safety, and security.</li>
    <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> if we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, we will notify you and your rights will continue to be protected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Feeding/pumping logs and profiles are retained until you delete them in the app or request deletion.</li>
    <li>Diagnostics and crash logs are typically retained for up to 24 months, unless a longer period is required for security, compliance, or debugging.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Your choices &amp; rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access, rectify, delete:</strong> you can edit or delete your data in the app. You can also request a copy or deletion by emailing <a href="mailto:erkancanmac@gmail.com">erkancanmac@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-out of analytics/notifications:</strong> control in the app and iOS Settings &gt; Notifications / Privacy.</li>
    <li><strong>EEA/UK/CH users:</strong> you may have rights to object or restrict processing, and to data portability. You can lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</li>
    <li><strong>California residents:</strong> you may have rights under the CCPA/CPRA, including access and deletion. We do not sell or “share” your data for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The app is designed for use by adults (parents/caregivers). We do not knowingly collect personal data directly from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data to us, contact us to delete it.</p>

  <h2>9) International transfers</h2>
  <p>We may process data on servers located outside your country. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) to protect your information.</p>

  <h2>10) Security</h2>
  <p>We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect your data (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; please use strong device passcodes and keep backups.</p>

  <h2>11) Third-party links</h2>
  <p>The app may link to third-party resources (e.g., help articles). Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.</p>

  <h2>12) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app or laws. We will post the new effective date above and, where appropriate, notify you in the app.</p>
